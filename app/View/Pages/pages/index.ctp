    <p>Our books are special; they are only complete when personalised. Select a book from our catalogue 
    (click on the book cover). You can immediately browse it, but to edit it you must register with this site.</p>
    <p>Change it to your requirements. We will save a draft copy so you can return and work on it for as long 
    as you need. When you are satisfied that it is finished, we send it to Lulu.com for printing and binding. 
    Lulu.com will take your payment and delivery details. Your finished books will be posted to you.</p>
    <p>For authors: If you would like us to publish your personalisable book, please contact us.</p>

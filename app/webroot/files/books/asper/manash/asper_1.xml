        <section id="1" font="12px" type="text"><![CDATA[The implementation of the Disability Discrimination Act, and its requirement that employers must make reasonable adjustments to enable disabled employees to attain to their full potential in the workplace, has made a major impact in recent years. Many employers now have a good understanding of the needs of a wide range of disabled people, and what they need to do to meet those needs.]]></section>
        <section id="2" font="12px" type="text"><![CDATA[However, understanding of the needs of people on the autistic spectrum, including those with Asperger syndrome (AS), is far less widespread. The fact is that people on the spectrum are hard-wired to interact differently in social situations, and problems can arise if the people around them - purely through ignorance or unfamiliarity - react badly to their non-standard behaviours.]]></section>
        <section id="3" font="12px" type="text"><![CDATA[Now, a short book has been written which helps to avoid this. The clear and simple illustrations show colleagues how the world can appear to the employee with AS, and demonstrate how small changes in approach can transform workplace relationships. The book gives colleagues a range of strategies to bridge the gap between the two perspectives; and in doing so, it will make the workplace a richer and more productive environment for everybody.]]></section>

            <p>Thanks for reading this.</p>
            <p>We hope it helps you and your colleague to work better together in the long run. You may have to re-evaluate how you view them; you might have formed wrong impressions already.</p>
            <p>Remember: they won't mind directness. So ask them anything that is on your mind about this. They'd really prefer it!</p>
            <p>We know some people don't like being direct; maybe they could send a note now and again.</p>
            <p>And some people won't enjoy working with others regardless - we know that. But since we can't 'take a hint' you'll have to tell us if you expect us to know!</p>
            <p>
            If you can, please: <br />
            - Be DIRECT with us
            - CHECK what we really mean
            - DON'T be embarrassed: enjoy our differences!
